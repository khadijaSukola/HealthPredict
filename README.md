Team HealthPredict is tackling the challenge of disease outbreak prediction and prevention in underserved communities. Our solution is a mobile and web application that leverages data science to predict potential outbreaks of diseases like malaria and cholera. By analyzing historical health data, environmental factors, and real-time health reports, our app provides early alerts to at-risk communities, enabling timely preventive action. The app also notifies nearby healthcare facilities, allowing them to prepare resources proactively. Our goal is to reduce disease spread, save lives, and empower communities with data-driven insights for better health outcomes.
